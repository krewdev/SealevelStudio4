Sealevel Studio: Investment & Partnership Proposal

Project: Sealevel Studio
Vision: The Interactive Transaction Simulator & Assembler for Solana.
Contact: James Young 300jayblackout@gmail.com

1. Executive Summary

Sealevel Studio is a web-based developer tool that solves the single biggest problem hindering Solana's developer adoption: the "black box" of transaction and instruction building. We are building the "Postman for Solana"—an interactive GUI that allows developers to visually assemble, simulate, debug, and export complex Solana transactions in real-time. This "glass box" approach will dramatically reduce the "glass-chewing" experience, accelerate developer onboarding, and reduce critical-error rates for protocols. We are seeking $150,000 in pre-seed/grant funding and strategic partnerships with key ecosystem players to build and launch our MVP.

2. The Problem: The "Glass-Chewing" Black Box

Solana's high-performance Sealevel runtime is a paradigm shift, but its stateless, account-based model creates a brutal developer experience (DevEx) for those coming from stateful models (like EVM or Web2).

Every Solana developer, from novice to expert, burns countless hours struggling with:

Manual Account Composition: "What accounts do I actually need for this instruction? In what order? Which ones are mut? Which are signer?"

Complex CPIs: Building transactions that call other programs (like the Token Program or Metaplex) is a process of blind trial and error.

Opaque Debugging: Transactions fail with cryptic errors like 0x1 (InvalidAccountData) or ConstraintHasOne, leaving developers to "guess-and-check."

State Verification: There is no simple way to answer: "What did my transaction actually do to the state on-chain?"

This friction is not just an inconvenience; it's a direct barrier to ecosystem growth, a source of security vulnerabilities, and a major cost in developer hours.

3. The Solution: "Sealevel Studio"

Sealevel Studio is the "glass box" that makes the black box transparent. It's a WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) editor for Solana's core building block: the transaction.

It's a web-based tool with four core features:

The Account Inspector: A UI to paste any on-chain account address. Sealevel Studio fetches, deserializes, and displays its data in a human-readable format, leveraging program IDLs (Anchor, Metaplex, etc.) to understand the structure.

The Instruction Assembler: A powerful builder where developers can select a program, choose an instruction (e.g., token_program::transfer), and visually fill in the required accounts. The tool validates inputs and constraints before sending.


The Simulation Engine (The "Gold" Feature): The "Simulate" button. Sealevel Studio forks the chain, runs the assembled transaction via a simulation RPC, and displays a clear "before-and-after" state diff. Developers instantly see exactly how their transaction mutated every account. It also displays compute units (CU) used and any console logs.

The Code Exporter: Once the transaction is perfect, the "Export" button generates the precise, copy-paste-ready client-side code (TypeScript, Rust) to execute that transaction in their dApp or integration tests.

4. Market & Ecosystem Impact

Target Market:

New Solana Developers: Drastically flattens the learning curve. This tool teaches the account model visually.


Sealevel Studio is the "Postman for Solana" — an interactive GUI that allows developers to visually assemble, simulate, debug, and export complex Solana transactions in real-time. Now powered by **Verisol-attested smart contracts** delivered as compressed NFTs (cNFTs), developers can drag-and-drop formally verified contracts onto the console for trustless transaction building.

This "glass box" approach dramatically reduces the "glass-chewing" experience, accelerates developer onboarding, and reduces critical-error rates for protocols by leveraging zero-knowledge proofs for smart contract verification.

Protocol & dApp Teams: Rapidly prototype, debug, and test new instructions and CPIs, saving hundreds of engineering hours.


Security Auditors: A power tool for modeling and verifying transaction behavior and state changes.

Solana Educators & Hackathons: The ultimate "learn-by-doing" environment.


- **Manual Account Composition**: "What accounts do I actually need? In what order?"
- **Complex CPIs**: Building transactions with other programs is blind trial and error
- **Opaque Debugging**: Cryptic errors like `0x1 (InvalidAccountData)` or `ConstraintHasOne`
- **State Verification**: No simple way to see "What did my transaction actually do?"
- **Contract Trust**: How can I be sure the smart contracts I'm using are secure?

Impact:


Accelerated Onboarding: Makes Solana as approachable as EVM from day one.

More Secure Protocols: Catches state-related bugs and errors before they hit production.
